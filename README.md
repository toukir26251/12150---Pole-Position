# 12150---Pole-Position
UVA 12150 - Pole Position Solve C++

Array c for cars and p for positions.
Array temp for the starting grid.

By Using p array I have tried to reconstruct the temp array which was initiated by 0 in all indexes.
If all indexes have a value instead of 0 the the starting grid is ok to be reconstructed.
